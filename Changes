Revision history for Kwiki-Edit-RequireUserName

0.02    2005/01/20
        No new features.
        Compatible with latest Kwiki 0.37 (changed how it hooks into Kwiki).
        There is a possibility that a bug in 0.01 existed where any edit
        always edited the top-level page.  This went undetected because I only
        tested with the top-level page.  This is now fixed.

0.01    2004/11/23
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
