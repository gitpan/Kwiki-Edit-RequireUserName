NAME
    Kwiki::Edit::RequireUserName - Replaces Kwiki::Edit in order to require
    a user name to edit

SYNOPSIS
    This plugin helps reduce WikiSpam by requiring that the user have a user
    name before editing. The idea is that SpamBots won't take the trouble to
    do this. Of course this won't prevent spam created manually.

REQUIRES
       Kwiki 0.37 (new hooking mechanism)
       Kwiki::UserName (adds user name functionality to Kwiki)
       Kwiki::UserPreferences (adds the ability to change user names)

INSTALLATION
       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

       cd ~/where/your/kwiki/is/located
       vi plugins

    Add the line

      Kwiki::Edit::RequireUserName

    If you don't already have them add the following also

      Kwiki::UserName
      Kwiki::UserPreferences

    Then run

      kwiki -update

UPGRADING
    The previous version of Kwiki::Edit::RequireUserName subclassed
    Kwik::Edit, so the old documentation asked you to remove Kwiki::Edit
    from your list of plugins. This new version of
    Kwiki::Edit::RequireUserName no longer subclasses Kwiki::Edit, so you
    should put that line back in.
